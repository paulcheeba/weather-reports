<H1 class="H9">Initial release bug fixes</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 28, 2023 - v1.0.1</p>
<p>Bug fixes:
<li>Jungle Rolltables - Had extra results left over from an earlier version. The results have been removed and the jungle roll tables are fixed.
<li>Forest Rolltables - Compendium UUID for Forest Spring was pointing to Jungle Spring. Correct UUID has ben entered and now rolls Forest Spring when requested.
<li>Readme - Didn't realize the images pasted into the journal were being saved as a png on the assests folder. Moved the images to the module /img/readme and correctly linked them in the readme.
<li>Readme - Added that Simple Calendar is required, not just recommended, for this current version and my be removed as a requirement in a future version.
<li>General - Added Simple Calendar as a Dependency for now, a future version will eventually include the option to enable/disable support for SC and FXMaster.

<H1 class="H9">Version 1.0 is LIVE!!!!</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 25, 2023 - v1.0</p>
<p>Version 1.0 is ready for public release. We now have 9 regions with individual seasonal roll tables, a custom interlinked journal filled with descriptions for each weather condition, a detailed readme to get you started, and finally.... Simple Calendar and FXMaster integration!</p>

<H1 class="H9">Finished regional seasonal roll tables</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 16, 2023 - still v0.1.7.1 alpha</p>
<p>I have finished all the roll-tables including each season for each region as well as temperatures for each season for each region. There are approximately 700 roll table results! Next up is to finish the regional seasonal macros and we, good folks, are ready for v1 release!</p>

<H1 class="H9">Started Working on regional seasonal macros</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 5, 2023 - still v0.1.7.1 alpha</p>
<p>I have created a new Base Generic WR macro with all the code to start making regional seasonal macros. I have created and add to compendia, the jungle seasons. I still need to link these with the WR Report generator macro. Then I need to add some actual flavor to the generator macro, with better CSS.</p>

<H1 class="H9">I have recovered all files!</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 5, 2023 - still v0.1.7.1 alpha</p>
<p>After many many hours I have managed to reproduce the lost files. Since then I began working on updating the old roll-table style with the new and now have the Jungle final roll-tables published. Next will be spicy, then I'll move onto the remaining regions. I have also started working on the generic macro making it ready for conversion to each and all of the regional seasonal macros. Exciting times and hard work ahead!</p>

<H1 class="H9">OMG I RECOVERED MOST OF EVERYTHING!</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 4, 2023 - still v0.1.7 alpha</p>
<p>I managed to piece the module back together after 8 hours of hunting down code snippets I posted on Discord. TIL I should be committing my work to new branches on github right away. Lesson learned?</p>

<h1 class="H9">OMG I LOST MOST OF EVERYTHING!</h1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 3, 2023 - v0.1.7alpha</p>
<p>Well, I messed up pretty bad. I accidentally overwrote my modules working files with v0.1.6 and lost all my scripts I made for the changelog and settings etc.</p>

<h1 class="H9">We Have Changelog!</h1>
<p class="versionNum">Feb 20, 2023 - v0.1.7alpha</p>
<p>In this update I have added a changelog dialog that can be dismissed or hidden until the next update. I have added configurable settings, including the option to unhide the changelog if the user accidently hides it rather than dismisses it. Another option I am fiddling with is themes, which I have several placeholders ready to be called on once I create the new themes.</p>
