<H1 class="H9">OMG I RECOVERED MOST OF EVERYTHING!</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 4, 2023 - still v0.1.7alpha</p>
<p>I managed to piece the module back together after 8 hours of hunting down code snippets I posted on Discord. TIL I should be commiting my work to new branches on github right away. Lesson learned?</p>

<h1 class="H9">OMG I LOST MOST OF EVERYTHING!</h1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 3, 2023 - v0.1.7alpha</p>
<p>Well, I messed up pretty bad. I accidently overwrote my modules working files with v0.1.6 and lost all my scripts I made for the changelog and settings etc.</p>

<h1 class="H9">We Have Changelog!</h1>
<p class="versionNum">Feb 20, 2023 - v0.1.7alpha</p>
<p>In this update I have added a changelog dialog that can be dismissed or hidden until the next update. I have added configurable settings, incliding the option to un-hide the changelog if the user accidently hides it rather than dismisses it. Another option I am fiddling with is themes, which I have several placeholders ready to be called on once I create the new themes.</p>
