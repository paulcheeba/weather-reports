<H1 class="H9">Finished regional seasonal roll tables</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Jan 1, 2023 - still v0.1.7.1 alpha</p>
<p>I have finished all the rolltables includinging each season for each region as well as tempuratures for each season for each region. There are approximately 700 roll table results! Next up is to finish the regional seasonal macros and we, good folks, are ready for v1 release!</p>

<H1 class="H9">Started Working on regional seasonal macros</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 5, 2023 - still v0.1.7.1 alpha</p>
<p>I have created a new Base Generic WR macro with all the code to start making regional seasonal macros. I have created and add to compendia, the jungle seasons. I still need to link these with the WR Report generator macro. Then I need to add some actual flavour to the generator macro, with better CSS.</p>

<H1 class="H9">I have recovered all files!</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 5, 2023 - still v0.1.7.1 alpha</p>
<p>After many many hours I have managed to reproduce the lost files. Since then I begn working on updating the old rolltable style with the new and now have the Jungle final rolltables published. Next will be spicy, then I'll move onto the rmaining regions. I have also started working on the generic macro making it ready for conversion to each and all of the regional seasonal macros. Exciting times and hard work ahead!</p>

<H1 class="H9">OMG I RECOVERED MOST OF EVERYTHING!</H1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 4, 2023 - still v0.1.7 alpha</p>
<p>I managed to piece the module back together after 8 hours of hunting down code snippets I posted on Discord. TIL I should be commiting my work to new branches on github right away. Lesson learned?</p>

<h1 class="H9">OMG I LOST MOST OF EVERYTHING!</h1>
<p class="versionNum">Mar 3, 2023 - v0.1.7alpha</p>
<p>Well, I messed up pretty bad. I accidently overwrote my modules working files with v0.1.6 and lost all my scripts I made for the changelog and settings etc.</p>

<h1 class="H9">We Have Changelog!</h1>
<p class="versionNum">Feb 20, 2023 - v0.1.7alpha</p>
<p>In this update I have added a changelog dialog that can be dismissed or hidden until the next update. I have added configurable settings, incliding the option to un-hide the changelog if the user accidently hides it rather than dismisses it. Another option I am fiddling with is themes, which I have several placeholders ready to be called on once I create the new themes.</p>
