While this module can be used in it's entirety directly from the Weather Reports compendia, <strong>it is recommended that you drag this macro directly to your hotbar: </strong>@UUID[Compendium.weather-reports.weather-macros.C2d3HNTuHL0ucEp8]{WR Regional Weather Reports Generator macro}.</span></p><p></p><img src=\"worlds/testingweatherreports/assets/pages/gdboJxIwtSQ6Q1KB-pages-3fUJwBqYlzcLXCEH-image-psfjgKaAaFDNffhH.png\" /><p><sup><sub><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">Left click and hold to grab and drag the above macro from the this page to your hotbar.</span></sub></sup></p><p></p><img src=\"worlds/testingweatherreports/assets/pages/gdboJxIwtSQ6Q1KB-pages-3fUJwBqYlzcLXCEH-image-MEdW6tE5XW8rBClI.png\" /><p><sup><sub><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">Or you can drag the macro from the Weather Reports Macros compendium to your hotbar.</span></sub></sup></p><p></p><img src=\"worlds/testingweatherreports/assets/pages/gdboJxIwtSQ6Q1KB-pages-3fUJwBqYlzcLXCEH-image-sXDoQ5D2vnZH1Gib.png\" /><p><sup><sub><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">Drag the macro to your hotbar. Then simply click the macro run a weather report!</span></sub></sup></p><p></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">How to use Weather Reports:</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">After you have dragged the macro to your hotbar, click it! You will be presented with multiple regions to choose from. Each region has four seasons that you will be prompted to choose from. Selecting a season rolls its specific series of roll-tables and outputs the results to chat, and at the same time sends those same details to Simple Calendar for tracking the event and its duration. (<em>Simple Calendar is not required to use this module but is highly recommended to get the complete Weather Reports experience</em>).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">The chat card contains the following information:</span></p><ol><li><p>Weather condition and link to the conditions descriptive journal entry.</p></li><li><p>FXMaster Effect button - clicking this will start the associated WR FXMaster Condition Effect.</p></li><li><p>Temperature description in both <span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif\">°C and °F.</span></p></li><li><p>Duration of the effect.

These are all included in the module's \"Weather Reports Macros\", \"Weather Reports Rolltables\" and \"Weather Reports Journals\" compendiums. The macros, roll-tables and journals do not need to be copied to your sidebar for the module to work as they are interlinked directly within the compendia.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">The macro rolls directly from your hotbar, which presents the DM with a list of regions that once a region is chosen, the DM is propted with a list of seasons for that region. When a regional season is selected it's associated series of roll-tables are rolled and the details are formatted and sent to the chat window as a chat card. At the same time the report is also sent to simple calendar and stored as a trackable event.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">There are currently over 700 possible results, including 100 wild magic surge conditions and several Strange Phenomena that may occur!</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">Future plans:</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">I will be fleshing out a DnD5e companion module at some point in the future. I intend on adding vanilla D&amp;D 5e SRD based condition automation with Dynamic Active Effects that will add conditions to all tokens when a Weather Report is applied to the scene.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">DAE will not be necessary to enjoy the module without any automation, but it would be recommended for the full experience when this feature is added. I also plan to add the ability to roll damage or request saving throws directly from a Journal entry or an Actor representing a Weather Condition that DM's can roll from.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">Please Note</span><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif\">†</span><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">:</span></h3><p><em>Please note that while this module is described as being system agnostic, the flavor used for the weather condition descriptions within the journal entries are geared towards DnD5e and PF2e as they include occasional damage rolls and saving throws. This added flavor in the descriptions has no mechanical function within the module and can be ignored when being used in other game systems. Future versions of this module may include a version of the Weather Reports journal that is 100% system agnostic within it's descriptions.</em></p><hr /><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">Credits:</span></h3><p>Special thanks to <span style=\"font-family:'gg sans', 'Noto Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\"><strong>Farling#9579, mxzf#5874, Freeze#2689, honeybadger#2614 and Zhell#9201 </strong></span>for their guidance when I struggled with the JS.</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">The \"Spicy\" rolltables included are based on homebrew by KibblesTasty https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M6xAC_2zw4BzpByxO-c .

These are all included in the module's \"Weather Reports Macros\", \"Weather Reports Rolltables\" and \"Weather Reports Journals\" compendiums. The macros, roll-tables and journals do not need to be copied to your sidebar for the module to work as they are interlinked directly within the compendia.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">The macro rolls directly from your hotbar, which presents the DM with a list of regions that once a region is chosen, the DM is propted with a list of seasons for that region. When a regional season is selected it's associated series of roll-tables are rolled and the details are formatted and sent to the chat window as a chat card. At the same time the report is also sent to simple calendar and stored as a trackable event.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">There are currently over 700 possible results, including 100 wild magic surge conditions and several Strange Phenomena that may occur!</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">Future plans:</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika\">I will be fleshing out a DnD5e companion module at some point in the future.
