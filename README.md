## Weather Reports
### A simple weather macro and rolltable set for any Foundry VTT system

This module contains one main macro, several reference macros, several rolltables and a journal complete with inter-linked weather conditions and effects.
To use this module, first copy the link to the manifest (below) then in foundry add a new module and paste the manifest link into the supplied field and press ok. Once the module is installed you can use it in several ways, either by running the macro from the Weather Reports journals title page located in the weather-journals compendium, running the Weather Report Generator macro directly from the weather-macros compendium or copying the Weather Report Generator macro to your macro folder and running it from there.

The macro gives you the option to roll from several seasons and situational effect rolltables. These are all included in the module's weather-rolltables and weather-journals compendiums, and do not need to be copied to your sidebar or hotbar to work, rather the macro rolls directly from the Weather Reports journal or weather-macros compendium. Each rolltable has links to specific conditions or effects for its season and outputs a message to chat complete with a link to the effect or conditions journal description.
