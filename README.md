## Weather Reports
### A simple weather macro and rolltable set for any Foundry VTT system

This module contains one main macro, several reference macros, several rolltables and a journal complete with inter-linked weather conditions and effects.
To use this module, first copy the link to the manifest (below) then in foundry add a new module and paste the manifest link into the supplied field and press ok. Once the module is installed you can use it in several ways, running the macro from the journals title page, running the macro directly from the compendium or copying the macro to your macro folder and running it from there.

The macro gives you the option to roll from several seasons and situational effect rolltables. These are all included in the module's compendiums, as with the effects and conditions journal entries needed and do not need to be copied to your sidebar to work, rather the macro rolls directly from the compendiums. Each rolltable has links to specific conditions or effects for its season.
