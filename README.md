## Weather Reports
### A simple weather macro and rolltable set for any Foundry VTT system

This module contains one easy to use Weather Report Generator macro, several reference macros, several homebrew rolltables and a journal complete with inter-linked weather conditions and effects.

### Installation:
To install this module, first copy the link to the manifest (below) then in foundry add a new module and paste the manifest link into the supplied field and press ok.

### How to use Weather Reports:
Once the module is installed you can use it in several ways, either by running the Weather Report Generator macro from the Weather Reports journal's title page located in the weather-journals compendium, running the Weather Report Generator macro directly from the weather-macros compendium or copying the Weather Report Generator macro to your macro folder or hotbar and running it from there.

### How Weather Reports works and what it does:
The macro gives you the option to roll from several seasons and situational effect rolltables. These are all included in the module's weather-rolltables and weather-journals compendiums, and do not need to be copied to your sidebar or hotbar to work, rather the macro rolls directly from the Weather Reports journal or weather-macros compendium. Each rolltable has links to specific conditions or effects for its season and outputs a message to chat complete with a link to the effect or conditions journal description.

### Future plans:
I intend on adding a vanilla D&D 5e SRD based set of conditions and keeping the current set as a "Spicy" set of conditions. I may also add Dynamic Active Effects that will add conditions to all tokens on a scene when a Weather Reports is applied to the scene. DAE will not be necessary to enjoy the module without any automation, but would be recommended for the full effects when this is added.

### Credits:
The "Spicy" rolltables included are based on homebrew by KibblesTasty (https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M6xAC_2zw4BzpByxO-c). You can find more homebrew by KibblesTasty at https://www.patreon.com/KibblesTasty. This module is a reimagining of an older module called Weather Effects that is no longer maintained (https://github.com/orangetruth/weather-effects-5e).
